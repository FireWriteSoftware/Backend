Install Articly for Nginx and [get started](https://github.com/KrbDevelopment/Articly-Documentation/wiki/Installation).

### Installing Frontend
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KrbDevelopment/Articly-Frontend
cd Articly-Frontend
npm i
npm run build
```

Copy over the .env.sample file into a file called .env. Fill out all data.

Point your webserver configuration onto the `dist`-folder's index.html. Double-check if the webserver has access to your `dist`-folder by using:

```bash 
chown -R www-data:www-data dist
```

For development purposes, you can use `npm run serve` instead of `npm run build`. This will launch a local dev server on port 8080.

### Installing Backend

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KrbDevelopment/Articly-Backend
cd Articly-Backend
composer i
```

Copy over the .env.example file into a file called .env. Fill out all important data, except for the `APP_KEY`.

Generate the app key by:
```bash 
php artisan key:generate
```

Install & setup passport for authentication:
```bash 
php artisan passport:install
```

Migrate database:
```bash 
php artisan migrate
```

Link storage folder for accessing images:
```bash 
php artisan storage:link
```

Optional: If you're experiencing weird error's, clearing the cache could help you:
```bash 
php artisan optimize 
```
